But, to lock the door he needs a key that is an anagram of a palindrome. He starts to go through his box of strings, checking to see if they can be rearranged into a palindrome. Given a string, determine if it can be rearranged into a palindrome. Return the string YES or NO.

Example

One way this can be arranged into a palindrome is . Return YES.
