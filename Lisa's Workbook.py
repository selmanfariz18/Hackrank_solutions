'''
Lisa just got a new math workbook. A workbook contains exercise problems, grouped into chapters. Lisa believes a problem to be special if its index (within a chapter) is the same as the page number where it's located. The format of Lisa's book is as follows:

There are  chapters in Lisa's workbook, numbered from  to .
The  chapter has  problems, numbered from  to .
Each page can hold up to  problems. Only a chapter's last page of exercises may contain fewer than  problems.
Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page will never contain problems from more than one chapter.
The page number indexing starts at .
Given the details for Lisa's workbook, can you count its number of special problems?

Example


Lisa's workbook contains  problems for chapter , and  problems for chapter . Each page can hold  problems.

The first page will hold  problems for chapter . Problem  is on page , so it is special. Page  contains only Chapter , Problem , so no special problem is on page . Chapter  problems start on page  and there are  problems. Since there is no problem  on page , there is no special problem on that page either. There is  special problem in her workbook.

Note: See the diagram in the Explanation section for more details.

Function Description

Complete the workbook function in the editor below.

workbook has the following parameter(s):

int n: the number of chapters
int k: the maximum number of problems per page
int arr[n]: the number of problems in each chapter
Returns
- int: the number of special problems in the workbook

Input Format

The first line contains two integers  and , the number of chapters and the maximum number of problems per page.
The second line contains  space-separated integers  where  denotes the number of problems in the  chapter.

Constraints

Explanation

The diagram below depicts Lisa's workbook with  chapters and a maximum of  problems per page. Special problems are outlined in red, and page numbers are in yellow squares.

There are  special problems and thus we print the number  on a new line.
